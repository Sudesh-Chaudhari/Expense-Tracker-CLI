```

## Visualizations

### üßæ Example CLI Menu
```yaml
----------- Welcome to Expense Tracker -----------

1. Add Expense
2. View Expenses
3. Update Expense
4. Delete Expense
5. Reports & Summaries
6. Forecast Expenses

Average Daily Spend    : ‚Çπ220.50
Projected Weekly Spend : ‚Çπ1543.50
Projected Monthly Spend: ‚Çπ6615.00
```

### üßæ Example Report
```yaml
Total Expenses : ‚Çπ5,850
Category Totals:
  - Food       : ‚Çπ2,100
  - Transport  : ‚Çπ1,200
  - Medical    : ‚Çπ500
Monthly Totals:

## Example Results

### ‚ûï Adding Expense
```bash
Enter date (YYYY-MM-DD): 2025-10-16
Enter category: Food
Enter amount: 350
Enter note (optional): Lunch at Cafe

2   2025-10-16  Transport  120.0    Bus fare
3   2025-10-16  Food       350.0    Lunch at Cafe

```

## Error Handling

- Invalid inputs trigger descriptive error messages.
- Database operations are wrapped in try-except blocks.
- Duplicate or missing IDs are safely handled.
- Fallback checks for database connectivity.

Example:
```python
try:
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM expenses")
except sqlite3.Error as e:
    print(f"Database error: {e}")
```

---

## Future Scope

- Export reports to CSV/Excel
- Add data visualization via Streamlit/Tkinter
- Introduce user authentication
- REST API for web/mobile apps
- Dashboard UI with filters and charts
